      <p class="text">"Where It All Began: On our first date, we wandered along the sun-kissed shores, hand in hand, our laughter mingling with the ocean's whisper. As we strolled, we discovered treasures from the sea—delicate shells and vibrant corals, each piece a precious keepsake of our time together. I've kept one of the corals, a symbol of the beauty and strength of our budding connection, while the sea shell you've held onto, dear, is a reminder of the gentle beginnings of our love. These treasures, much like our memories, are irreplaceable, echoing the promise of many more shared moments under the vast, endless sky."</p>

      <p class="text">"At Kurumba Bay, our footsteps echoed on the sandy paths under the whispering leaves, each step a shared moment of joy and discovery. That day was filled with laughter and gentle confessions, our connection deepening with each glance and smile exchanged under the dappled sunlight. The beach walk was not just a stroll but a dance of souls, weaving memories that the tides could never wash away. Kurumba wasn't just a backdrop; it was a witness to our growing bond, promising many more shared sunsets and whispers with the sea as our confidante."</p>

  <p class="animate-fade-in">Hey love,
    <br>
    Happy Valentine’s Day Bubs! I hope your exams are going well and that you're settling in nicely. I know this website isn't perfect—I had to put it together quickly before heading abroad—but I poured my heart into it, and I hope it brings a smile to your face.
    <br>
    I can’t wait for the day after your exams, when we can finally meet so I can help ease some of your stress and share some special moments together. You mean the world to me, and I truly believe you deserve to be loved deeply every single day. If you ever feel that our journey together should come to an end, I understand; I only ask that you let me know in advance. No matter what, I'll always be here, waiting for you and loving you more with each passing moment.
    <br>
    With all my love,
    <BR>
    Pookie
